# Breaking's Nixos Configuration! Now (again) rewritten! (v3)
v3 of my Nixos Configuration. Rewritten and more organized!

> [!NOTE]
> This configuration will continue to grow, and with it this README!
> This is not the end yet...

## Difference between v2 and v3
- Snowflake lib usage
- I learned more and more in my v2 Configuration, and now I can optimize it here!
- git actions, and more new functions!

## Installation

### Rebuild commands
> [!WARNING]
> If you get the error "cant install not pure..." then use the `--impure` argument

### Other ways to install
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the near future their will be (hopefully) an option to install the entire system with Windows as an ISO file!
